        <h2> The significant events in Mahatma Gandhi's life</h2>
        <h3>Birth and Early Life (1869-1888):</h3>
        <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi is born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, Gujarat, India.
         He grows up in a devout Hindu family and receives a traditional education.
         Gandhi gets married to Kasturba Makhanji at the age of 13.</p>

        <h3>Education and Legal Career (1888-1893):</h3>
        <p>Gandhi travels to England in 1888 to study law at University College London.
        He becomes involved in social and political issues, including the vegetarian movement, religion, and the Indian diaspora.
        Gandhi is called to the bar in 1891 and returns to India in 1893.</p>

        <h3>South Africa and Early Activism (1893-1914):</h3>
        <p>Gandhi moves to South Africa in 1893 to work as a lawyer and advocate for the Indian community.
        He experiences racial discrimination firsthand, which sparks his activism against injustice.
        Gandhi establishes the Natal Indian Congress in 1894 and leads various nonviolent protests and campaigns against discriminatory laws.</p>

        <h3>Return to India and Leadership (1915-1920):</h3>
        <p>Gandhi returns to India in 1915 and becomes involved in the Indian independence movement.
        He takes on the leadership of the Indian National Congress and promotes nonviolent civil disobedience as a means of resistance.
        Gandhi launches campaigns against oppressive practices such as untouchability, poverty, and the British salt monopoly.</p>

        <h3>Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-1922):</h3>
        <p>Gandhi leads the Non-Cooperation Movement in 1920, calling for Indians to boycott British institutions, including schools, courts, and products.
        The movement gains widespread support but is suspended following the Chauri Chaura incident, where violence breaks out in 1922.</p>

        <h3>Salt March and Civil Disobedience (1930-1931):</h3>
        <p>Gandhi initiates the Salt March (also known as the Dandi March) in 1930 to protest the British salt tax.
        The march covers a distance of 240 miles and becomes a symbol of nonviolent resistance.
        Gandhi is arrested, along with thousands of other protesters, but his actions draw international attention to the Indian independence struggle.</p>

        <h3>Quit India Movement (1942-1944):</h3>
        <p>Gandhi launches the Quit India Movement in 1942, demanding an end to British rule in India.
        He advocates for nonviolent resistance and urges Indians to "Do or Die" in their struggle for independence.
        The movement is met with a strong British crackdown, and many leaders, including Gandhi, are imprisoned.</p>

        <h3>Partition and Independence (1947):</h3>
        <p>India gains independence from British rule on August 15, 1947, but it is accompanied by the partition of British India into India and Pakistan.
        Gandhi works tirelessly to promote peace and harmony between Hindus and Muslims but faces challenges due to communal violence.
        Tragically, on January 30, 1948, Gandhi is assassinated by Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist.</p>
